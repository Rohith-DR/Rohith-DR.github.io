OBJECTIVE
To pursue a role in the VLSI domain where I can utilize my knowledge of electronics, HDL-based design, and analytical problem-solving to work on advanced chip design and verification projects.
EXPERIENCE
Jr Research Fellow (R V college of engineering)			              	  Bat Conservation India Trust | [04-08-2025]
•	Designed and implemented an IoT system based on Raspberry Pi with a client–server architecture, embedded firmware in C and Python, custom PCB design, functional prototypes, and successful field validation.
•	Engineered and prototyped an ultrasonic microphone system capable of capturing bat echolocation signals from 15 kHz to beyond 180 kHz, followed by successful real-world field testing.
VSDSquadron Mini Internship							      Vlsi System Design | [19-01-2025]
•	Designed a Shipment Tracking System in C, compiled it using PlatformlO with the RISC-V toolchain for hardware-level implementation insights.
•	Engaged in a 4-week intensive research internship, focusing on the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V development board, strengthening skills in embedded systems and processor design.
